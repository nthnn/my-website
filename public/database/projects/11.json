Using an 128x64 monochromatic OLED and a capacitive touch sensor And yeah, it's all fun and games.</p><br/><h3 class=\"shimmer\">Wiring</h3><p>The wiring is simple to do, as shown in the diagram below. I've used an I2C bus so that it won't be a pain to wire up and solder a 7-pin monochromatic OLED display.</p><p>Disclaimer: I used <a href=\"https://fritzing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fritzing</a> to create the diagram below.</p><div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/projects/project_12_diagram.png\"><img class=\"col-12 col-lg-5\" src=\"/images/projects/project_12_diagram.png\" /></a></div><br/><br/><h3 class=\"shimmer\">Demo</h3><hr/><p>Here's an actual demo of the project.
