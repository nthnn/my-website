    "content": "<p>The Complex Compute Core Engine (C3E) is a framework library developed in pure C, designed to enhance computational capabilities across various platforms. The library includes several distinct builds, each specifically developed for different use cases, making it a highly adaptable solution for both server computing, desktop and embedded systems. With C3E, developers can build powerful applications that efficiently utilize advanced computational resources, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.</p><p>C3E have a Debian package (*.deb) deployable on Debian-based operating systems. This build functions as a C/C++ library, providing developers with the functionality integrating C3E's capabilities directly into their applications. This library package ensures easy installation and compatibility with a wide range of systems, making it accessible to a broader audience. Developers can harness the power of C3E to enhance their software with advanced computational features, enabling applications to handle more complex tasks and deliver better performance.</p><br/><h3 class=\"shimmer\">Getting Started</h3><hr/><h4 class=\"shimmer\">Installing C3E on Debian-Based Linux Distributions</h4><p>To install the C3E library as a shared library on Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, Parrot, Parsix, etc.), follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Download the Package: Obtain the *.deb package from the C3E <a href=\"https://github.com/nthnn/c3e/releases\" target=\"_blank\">release</a> page.</li><li>Install the Package: Use the dpkg command to install the package. Run the following command in your terminal:<br/><br/><div style=\"overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;\"><pre style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #00aa00\">sudo</span> dpkg -i c3e_*.deb</pre></div></li></ol><br/><h4 class=\"shimmer\">Using the C3E Library</h4><p>After installation, you can link the C3E library in your C programs by adding <kbd>-lc3e -lm</kbd> to the compiler's arguments. The <kbd>-lm</kbd> flag links the standard math library, which is often required for mathematical functions, especially in statically linked programs.</p><div class=\"alert bg-info text-white mt-4\"><b><i class=\"bi bi-info-circle\"></i> Note</b><p class=\"mt-2 mb-0\">The <kbd>-lm</kbd> flag is necessary for linking the math library, which provides essential mathematical functions not included in the standard C library. This is particularly important when building statically linked programs.</p></div><br/><h3 class=\"shimmer\">Use Cases</h3><hr/><ol><li><h5>Scientific Computing</h5><ul><li><p>Scientists can run large-scale simulations for climate modeling, astrophysics, and molecular dynamics by utilizing the x86-based C3EPU.
