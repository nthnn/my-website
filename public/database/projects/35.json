    "content": "<p>N2CMU is a project aimed at implementing a neural network coprocessing microcontroller unit (MCU) for STM32F103C8T6 Bluepill development board using the TinyGo (Go programming language for embedded systems). This MCU enables offloading feedforward neural network computations to a dedicated hardware unit, allowing for efficient and low-power feedforward neural network training and inference on small hardware embedded systems.</p><br/><h3 class=\"shimmer\">Features</h3><hr/><ul><li><b>Neural Network Coprocessing</b><p>N2CMU allows offloading feedforward neural network computations to a dedicated coprocessing unit, freeing up the main microcontroller for other tasks.</p></li><li><b>UART Communication</b><p>Communication with N2CMU is facilitated via UART, enabling external devices to control and interact with the coprocessing unit.</p></li><li><b>Flexible Configuration</b><p>N2CMU supports dynamic configuration of neural network parameters such as input, hidden, and output neuron counts, as well as weights, biases, and gradients.</p></li><li><b>Training and Inference</b><p>The coprocessing unit supports both training and inference modes, allowing for the optimization of neural network models directly on the microcontroller.</p></li></ul><br/><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-lg-6\"><a href=\"/images/projects/project_36_02.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/projects/project_36_02.jpg\" width=\"100%\" /></a></div><div class=\"col-lg-6\"><a href=\"/images/projects/project_36_01.png\"><img src=\"/images/projects/project_36_01.png\" width=\"100%\" /></a></div></div>"
