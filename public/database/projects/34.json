This project aims to create a small, emotionally expressive device with a 0.96-inch monochromatic OLED display serving as its facial interface, and a momentary button for user interaction. The name &quot;Tomo&quot; is inspired by the Japanese character &quot;Âèã,&quot; which translates to &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;companion,&quot; reflecting the nature of this delightful creation.</p><p>Tomo embodies the essence of companionship in a compact and accessible form factor, offering users a unique blend of technology and emotional connection. Its minimalist design and intuitive interaction model make it suitable for various applications, from personal entertainment to educational tools.</p><br/><br class=\"mobile-only\" /></div><div class=\"col-lg-3\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/projects/project_35_01.png\"><img src=\"/images/projects/project_35_01.png\" width=\"80%\" /></a></div></div>"
